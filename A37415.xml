            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt: I find the Debtor ſafe enough, being fully Acquitted: the Common Law, by the 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth in ſome ſence, quadrare or readily Aſſent, in caſe of Infancy: As in an Executor, if Payment be actually Prov'd, it ſhall Bind.

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99081:17"/>
                  <p>At Common Law, I agree the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian would hardly be Acquitted; though with the Privity and Intreaty of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant: if a waſte were Committed.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Chancery is the <hi>Commanding Court,</hi> and out of Diſpute, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable uſe and Excellency: when kept within its Bounds: otherwiſe the Law would prove in many Caſes, an abſolute Tyrant; and not to be Endur'd. The Conſequences are ſo vulgar and eaſily to be Conjectur'd, that I need not Englarge on ſo obvious a Truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Were the Proceedings ſhorten'd; and the Flippancy of Motions, to multiply order upon order, and Report upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; with other out-ſlips, Revis'd and Amended: the Court would be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Honoured, and the oppreſſed much Rejoyc'd and Repair'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A peremptory Time ſhould be Aſſign'd to Anſwer; otherwiſe the Bill to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, as Taken <hi>pro Confeſſo:</hi> And why ſhould it be otherwiſe? ſince 'tis <hi>natural for the weakeſt Perſon living, to Appear and make his Defence,</hi> if wrongfully charg'd: And to be Reimburs'd of the Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99081:33"/>if unjuſtly vex'd: And therefore Shifting by Buying of Attachments, and Dallying with the Court; implies clearly Guilt: And ſo no Injuſtice (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) if the Cauſe be Given, againſt Him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſame at Common Law, is the Conſtant Practice upon Iſſue: for if the Defendant will not Appear and Plead, Judgment <hi>on nient Dedire,</hi> or by Default on Courſe is Ruled againſt Him. Which proves as Forcible, as if obtain'd on full Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Nay in Criminal Concerns, if the Party <hi>Encoup'd</hi> or Arraign'd; ſtand mute and refuſe to Plead: He's uſually ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd to <hi>Peine fort and Dure,</hi> or Preſs'd to Death. A grievous Puniſhment, which certainly none but the <hi>Meſcrue</hi> or <hi>Deſperate in Guilt,</hi> would undergo. If by Pleading, or Palliating their Crimes by a Civil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; they might probably find Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A ſet Time likewiſe in their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to prove their Allegations: with the like to the Defendant, to Diſcharge and Acquit Himſelf: would ſtrike off much Fraud and Delay. And not to be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99081:34"/>ſuffer'd, to move for Commiſſion upon Commiſſion, and Examinings upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminings: the uſual Practice, with the wealthy and vexatious, to weary out the poor Adverſary; and thereby obtain their Ends.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some conceive that Attachments, Writs of Rebellion, Serjeants at Arms, and the like, are not of abſolute neceſſity; eſpecially to the Ends they are now Commonly made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Neither can they Divine, if ſuch Times be Peremptory upon them, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>per ſe,</hi> or <hi>per Alium;</hi> in Perſon or by Attorney: what miſchief can Enſue. Unleſs good Cauſe be ſhew'd, to induce the Court, to Enlarge the Time.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sequeſtrations may be neceſſary, in caſe of Diſobediences to Decrees: But what need of <hi>tedious Proceedings;</hi> which are mighty Expenſive and Dilatory: and in <hi>effect a kind of negation or Denyal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This with all dutiful Reverence, to the <hi>Supreme Court:</hi> conceiving what I humbly offer, will in no Reſpect, retard Juſtice; nor blemiſh Equity.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Conceive the Priviledge neither ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendible nor Abateable, by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate nor even judicial Act, of the Perſon Priviledg'd: without notorious Breach of Truſt; and the Peril too of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Neither can this admit of any Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or wonder, when his Condition is throughly viewed, and in what capacity he mov'd.</p>
                  <p>The capacity being publick: ſo not to be quitted, on a perſonal Account, or Privacy of Deſign: And therefore if weary of his Procuratorſhip, He ought to ſignifie his Debility or Wearineſs to Continue: And the Delegators or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Electing, left to their choice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute another in his ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Not Deputable or Aſſignable.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is Regularly in Law, <hi>that he cannot Depute a Proxy,</hi> or Aſſigne: becauſe choſen and Truſted by others, Moving in <hi>auter Droit;</hi> and ſo not Maſter of himſelf,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99081:64"/>to Aſſign or transfer the publick Deliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Truſt to others.</p>
                  <p>Truſts not Delegable.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this more plainly by the Common Practice: <hi>If</hi> A. <hi>be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by</hi> B. <hi>for the uſe of</hi> C. <hi>and others; and he accept the Truſt: He can hardly transfer this Truſt, without the conſent of the Parties entruſting: ſhould he do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Privity and Aſſent, Equity (as well as common Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility) will take it ill: and award the Parties Damages, the Injury being Relievable by Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Caſe of Factorſhip or Common Attorneyſhip makes it plainer: for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undertake more, then what they can well perform, if the Clients receive loſs, 'tis Remediable by Action: ſo they're Confin'd to Mediocrity, though they uſually moyl themſelves, over ſhooes and Boots, and engroſs more then they can well graſp.</p>
                  <p>Much ſtronger in the Parliamentary undertaking; there's no Remedy over, if any, the Damage may be ſo Immenſe:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99081:64"/>that 'tis Impoſſible for a ſingle fortune, to ſatisfie: therefore on neceſſity, <hi>the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge not Quittable:</hi> otherwiſe the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſhall be in a worſe Condition, then the Private: which no Law will admit, but ſtill on the Contrary, the Rule being undeniable over the whole Face of the Earth, <hi>Better one ſuffer then the whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Caſe lately of the Lord <hi>S.</hi> in <hi>B.

                  <p>Neither can Conſent in Adjournment, though a vacancy from the <hi>publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,</hi> quit the Priviledge: becauſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable at the Royal Pleaſure, before the time appointed.</p>
                  <p>In Prorogations I agree the Priviledge
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99081:65"/>ſuſpended: But that's by Act of Law, and a <hi>quaſi Diſſolution for the time:</hi> and ſo no Right violated, the Publick at no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment or Danger.</p>
                  <p>Should any be ſo eaſie in Relinquiſhing the Priviledge, I Conceive 'tis a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and no ſmall Diſhonour to the Houſe: no way to extinguiſh it but by Act, and I much queſtion, whether that can do it, becauſe of <hi>Entailing a Wrong on Poſterity.</hi>

                  <p>With the Wiſeman, <hi>Silence ſeldom hurts,</hi> but <hi>Openneſs is a certain Damage:</hi> I ſhall therefore Conceal my thoughts, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Priviledge better Preſerv'd, then Expos'd to ſuſpenſion or Diſpute.</hi>

                  <p>Puniſhing Theft with Death Conſiſts with Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt. I conceive the Moſaical Laws, are not ſimply, only modally; not Abſolutely, only Directorily Binding to us: therefore Chriſtian States, have <hi>decoll'd</hi> or taken off capitally, Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; mulcted by them only by <hi>Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or like Damage.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:99081:113"/>
                  <p>That there's no Parity between Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and the <hi>Purloin</hi> or thing ſtoln; I agree it, taken materially: But in the Pilfery, we muſt Conſider, not the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling alone our neighbour; but the Breach of the Peace: And therein not only ſetting at naught, but Reſiſting the whole State. And that <hi>the Publick Peace, is much dearer and valuable; then any ſingle Tear-grounds life:</hi> no Brow form'd of Braſs will deny.</p>
                  <p>But other Pains (they ſay) might be Inflicted, not Death; and in every petty ſlide, the Peace is equally broken, as in weightier matters.</p>
                  <p>Laws muſt be modell'd, according to the Temper of the Clime: And the Sword of Juſtice is ſoly at publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And therefore among the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, where Thieving (if ſome write true) is almoſt as much in uſe as Eating; doubtleſs ſtricter Pains juſtifiable: Hence our <hi>Hallifax</hi> Law, may not be Amiſs, in favour of Property, to promote Trade.</p>
                  <p>The Diverſity of Laws.</p>
                  <p>By ſome Laws Stealing an Oxe or an Horſe is not Felony: But for a Capon or Pig, I find the Stealer muſt be <hi>Pandue</hi> or ſuffer Death.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:99081:113"/>
                  <p>At Common Law, originally <hi>Cutting</hi> on the Road, no <hi>ſuſpend' per Coll.</hi> an Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Truſs; only a moral Failing, or Treſpaſs: afterwards the loſs of the Thumb. Now by neceſſity in State, a <hi>Tyburn Chook;</hi> otherwiſe Property nor Life could not be preſerv'd: which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines agree lawful.</p>
                  <p>So formerly Counterfeiting the Great Seal, but Felony; now Treaſon: Rape at Common Law, no <hi>ten Groats mulct,</hi> according to <hi>Solon</hi>'s Ordinance; but the loſs of Eyes and Teſticles: now by <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> the firſt, <hi>Felony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Civil and Common Law, to Steal a Sheep out of the Fold, or an Oxe out of the Herd, 'tis Theft: by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> to rob a Dovecote 'tis Larceny. But at Common Law, Beaſts untam'd may be Taken without the Danger of Felony: But if Tame and Domeſtical, the Taker is by the Common Law, no better then a Felon. Maliciouſly to crop or cut a Vine, by the Civil Law; 'tis Puniſhable as Theft. Thus <hi>Pains vary (according to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and neceſſity of Affairs) by the Prudence of Divines and Lawyers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At Common Law generally, ſuch is the Candour of Juſtice; <hi>the Pain muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Offence:</hi> for if the Damage be

                  <p>As Preventives againſt future Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, ſometimes Puniſhments are not <hi>Ouelment</hi> or evenly impos'd: As the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for waſte, gives <hi>valorem vaſti in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo,</hi> treble Damage with the Place Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
                  <p>The like for Defrauding ſpiritual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>treble Amends:</hi> otherwiſe farewel Religion; the Church Door may be nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; ſignifying indeed no more then a Steeple-Houſe; when the Paſtour is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd, by ſubſtracting his Livelihood.</p>
                  <p>War ought not to be made, but on juſt Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Ground of War, Divinity and Politicks, ſever much in opinion: the one limiting it Strictly, for Wrongs firſt ſuſtained; the other takes it more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conceiving a deliberate Fear, of an Approaching Danger, good Cauſe of unſheathing the Sword.

                  <p>For the lawfulneſs of it: for <hi>Defenſive or Reparative Cauſes,</hi> few Divines doubt: for Avengement and Enlarging Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with little ſleights; <hi>meer Fumes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> there <hi>Coeli Injuria, Coelo Cura:</hi> an Appeal to Heaven, is the only Cure, I ſhould Adviſe. <hi>Every publick Abuſe being Recorded above,</hi> as done to the Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of the Omnipotent. And ſuch are moſt Proper, for the great Judicatory, not Impleadable below. But that the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Souldier is totally unlawful; a common Conceit with the Croſs-grain'd, I cannot Agree: For then the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Faith, would not have been Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; nor that famous Convert, ſecur'd Himſelf, againſt the Perfidiouſneſs of the Jews, by the aid of Sword-men.</p>
                  <p>War not fair and King-like, without warning by Proclaiming.</p>
                  <p>In Peace if at <hi>Civil Warfare,</hi> notice by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99081:115"/>Summons and Citations be peremptorily Requir'd: that Dodgers take no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, with Covinous Tricks, by Packing the Cards: the like in <hi>Military,</hi> by noble Spirits 'tis thought Cowardly and mean, to ſneak upon the Injuror, without <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing open Defiance:</hi> for this I find the Authority an <hi>Ipſe Dixit,</hi> enjoyn'd by God himſelf. <hi>David</hi> indeed for the Abuſe to his Embaſſadours, did wage War againſt the Ammonites: But not without giving them notice, of his Intention; to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein I find the Concurrence of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Paſcatia's de la Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> Caſe a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> whom the Judges conceiv'd no Enemy, to be deny'd the Benefit of Juſtice; till open War were proclaim'd, between both Kingdoms; though ſeveral Acts of Hoſtility were Committed.</p>

                  <p>By this we may Collect, that a Prince may juſtifie Arms; if ſatisfaction by <hi>amicable Demands</hi> be deny'd: But to ſnatch and pilfer a Booty; by Law Military, without Proclaiming War, and <hi>Throwing of the Dart,</hi> is doubtleſs very un-Prince-like

                  <p>'TIS the Doubt of many, eſpecially of Divines; whether the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be ſtill <hi>Teneble in Conſcience:</hi> I'm clear in the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt in Law: the Converting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>lay-Fee,</hi> was no Chimney-Corner Act; the Off-ſpring of Paſſion or Infidelity: but the publick Judgment, or full Debate of the whole People, pronounc'd in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Adjudging by wearied Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Droning over notorious; and the Church cloyed with <hi>Superſtitious Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury:</hi> which render'd their Office uſeleſs and Abominable. Being too great an Engroſſer of the Temporalty, <hi>beyond the Cure of Viſiting or Purging:</hi> ſo the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or total Aboliſhing, no Infeudations of Rapine or oppreſſion. It being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Power, that Created them; that Diſanull'd them. The Law that gave them a Being, without Injury to Church or State, might likewiſe Diſſolve them. And we are not to Conceive, the leaſt Prejudice imaginable againſt their Inact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: being Preſumed, no ſober Perſon in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99081:143"/>his right Wits, will ever wilfully wrong another: nay wittingly deſtroy his own ſoul. For ſo had it been, were not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing, neceſſary and Civil.</p>
                  <p>The Diſſolving maintain'd in Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Niceneſs in Divinity: how a Spiritual uſe (without violence to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) can be Tranſmuted, into a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; Contrary to the Will of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: is a Demurrer that ſticks with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of ſingular Parts. But thorowly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, there's no juſt Cauſe of Scruple. <hi>A Surfeit being better ſpar'd then continued:</hi> therefore the Taking them off, <hi>an Act no way Dolorous, or Inconvenient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Worſhip of God, conſiſting not <hi>wholly in the Eſtate Spiritual:</hi> the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Temporal, doth no leſs glorifie him. For if that Faint, the other will hardly Flouriſh: ſo that there's a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to uphold the one, to ſupport the other: And we may diſcharge a good Conſcience, very liberally, to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor of the Soul;</hi> as much as Heaven doth require: without making him an Idol (like the Dotage of thoſe Times) in Offering All we have; to <hi>purchaſe a Kiſs
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99081:143"/>of St.</hi> Jude, <hi>or a ſmile from St.</hi> Peter, and be laugh'd at for our Pains.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Were the Church much Impair'd, ſo Beggard; that an able Clergy, could not be maintain'd: And all Encouragements taken away, to incite Youth to the Study thereof: And thereby the Service of God neglected, and like to fall; or even the <hi>Votaries to Virtue,</hi> at all Damnified: I ſhould Agree the Negative.</p>
                  <p>But ſufficient being ſtill left (if us'd ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly) to propagate Religion: And no juſt cauſe of ſuſpecting, any Decay of Learning: the Remains being moſt fair and Inviting, Means ſtill enough for the higheſt Merit: I cannot ſee, with the ſearch of both Eyes (as the Church now ſtands) what Annoyance, the 27 or 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. can be, to any intelligent and Loyal Conſcience: that's <hi>a true Obediencer to King and Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aboliſhing not Contrariant to Civil Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If not Continued Spiritually, why not Reverted to the Right Heirs?</p>
                  <p>This Requeſt ſeems Plauſible; had not ſo many Centuries paſs'd, that the right
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99081:144"/>Heirs (without a Divinour) could hardly have been found out: A multitude of Claims, would ſoon have put in, and the very true Heir, ſcarce have ever been Known: And ſo the Land given back, to meer Pretenders and falſe Owners: Then <hi>the Cure worſe then the Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Infadation of Droneries, or Permuting them to a ſecular Free-hold, warrantable in Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But had the Inſtitution been ſo Freſh, that the lineal Heir, had been then Alive: and Certainly Deſcrib'd and Known. However the Tranſmutation lawful.</p>
                  <p>The Giving being Intentionally Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and Conſecrated for a general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: happily a By-bag, or ſpare Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; that the Heir might well part with, and never ſleep the Worſe: And ſo not originally Deſign'd for Him, but Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly always put aſide by the Giver; for that Purpoſe: The Diſpoſing of the Grant, to another end; then what was Directed by the Grantor: will be neither <hi>Forfeiture nor Fruſtration of the Grant.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtill enjoy'd by the Publick, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Intent of the Giver; the Gift

                  <p>Agreeable with Foreign Laws.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this any ſuddain opinion, without Authority; for the Civil Law allows of the Converſion, as Legal and Honourable:</p>

                  <p>TO inforce an Equality in the Church, from <hi>a Parity among the Apoſtles;</hi> is a Claſſical Cavil, but no authentick Debating: a Preſident not ſquare with Divinity, or <hi>well-digeſted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> Law.</p>

                  <p>A Friend will ſtick to the End, and therefore ought to be put in the Boſom, and made much of: for his Integrity will avail more, in Time of Need; then a Crowd of Foes, <hi>ſeemingly Fetch'd off,</hi> with eaſie yieldings to Ignorance and Pride: Muffling their Paſſions, from open Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, till opportunity invite them, to Staring Frantickneſs.</p>
